  Image scaling and padding and field order adjustment.
notes: >
  Normally resize is used to pad the producer's output to what the consumer has 
  requested after an upstream rescale filter first scales the image to maximise 
  usage of the image area. This filter also adjusts the field order to lower 
  field first if the frame property "top_field_first" has been set to 1. 
  Therefore, when done, it sets the top_field_first to 0. This filter is 
  automatically invoked by the loader as part of image sample aspect ratio 
  normalisation.
bugs:
  - Assumes lower field first output.
