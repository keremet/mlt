      The name of a file in which to store the XML.
      If the value does not contain a period (to start an extension), then
      the value is interpreted as the name of a propery in which to store the
      XML. This makes it easy for an application to use the consumer to
      serialize a service network and retrieve the XML in-memory.

    title: Process all frames
    type: integer
    description: >
      Without this option, the XML consumer does not process any frames
      and simply serializes the service network. However, some filters (.e.g,
      videostab) require two passes where the first pass performs some
      analysis and stores the result in a property. Therefore, set this
      property to 1 (true) to cause the consumer to process all frames
      before serializing to XML.
