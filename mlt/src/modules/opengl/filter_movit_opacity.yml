description: Adjust the opacity of an image through the alpha channel.
notes: >
  When used in some transitions this will cause this video to be mixed with
  the other video. If the video this is applied to already has an alpha channel,
  then this preserves that by multiplying the opacity level with the alpha channel.
  This filter is especially handy when used in conjunction with movit.overlay.

  - identifier: opacity
