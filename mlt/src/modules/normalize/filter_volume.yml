  - identifier: argument
    title: Gain
    type: string
    description: >
      The gain may be indicated as a floating point value of the gain
      adjustment.
       
      The gain may also be indicated as a numeric value with the suffix "dB"
      to adjust in terms of decibels.
       
      The gain may also be set to "normalise" to normalise the volume to the
      target amplitude -12dBFS.
  - identifier: window
    title: Window
    type: integer
    description: >
       The number of video frames over which to smooth normalisation.
    default: 75
    mutable: yes
  - identifier: normalise
    title: Normalise
    type: string
    description: >
      Normalise the volume to the specified amplitude.
       
      The normalization may be indicated as a floating point value of the
      relative volume.
       
      The normalisation may also be indicated as a numeric value with the
      suffix "dB" to set the amplitude in decibels.
    default: -12dBFS
    mutable: yes
  - identifier: limiter
    title: Limiter
    type: string
    description: >
      Limit all samples above the specified amplitude.
       
      The limiting may be indicated as a floating point value of the
      relative volume.
       
      The limiting may also be indicated as a numeric value with the suffix
      "dB" to set the limiting amplitude in decibels.
    default: -6dBFS
    mutable: yes
  - identifier: max_gain
    title: Max gain
    type: string
    description: >
      A floating point or decibel value of the maximum gain that can be
      applied during normalisation.
    default: 20dB
    mutable: yes
  - identifier: end
    title: End gain
    type: string
    description: >
      A gain value just like the Gain property. This causes the gain to be
      interpolated from 'gain' to 'end' over the duration.
    mutable: yes
