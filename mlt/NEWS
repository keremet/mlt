MLT Release Notes
-----------------

Version 0.5.4

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is another maintenance release to address some bugs that appeared
this far in the 0.5.x series. Beyond that it adds two things that only
very specific users will see:

* Added C# (ECMA CLR) binding (not enabled by default).
* Linsys SDI consumer now configures itself from MLT profile.


Version 0.5.2

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is a minor maintenance release, but it is interesting because it now
enables usage of libswscale as the default choice for image scaling,
image format conversion, and color space conversion. That gives better
quality and performance. In addition, there are some improvements in the
sdl_preview consumer to make it suitable for use in OpenShot 1.1. Other
things:

* Fixed mlt++/MltFilteredProducer
* Fixed playing to the end in Kdenlive (mantis bug 1207)
* Fixed crash load uncompressed video
* Fixed compiling yadif for non-sse2 builds


Version 0.5.0

The recommended version of FFmpeg for use with this release is SVN r21322.
This is an enhancement release, confined mainly to the modules rather than
the framework. In particular, this adds support for VDPAU, YADIF, and HD-SDI
technologies!

configure: added --disable-sse2

framework:
* mlt_cache: added mlt_cache_set_size()
* mlt_filter: added data property "service" - set when attached
* mlt_frame:
  - added Doxygen docs
  - added "previous frame" and "next frame" data properties - available
    when its producer has _need_previous_next=1
* mlt_playlist: added support for negative out point same as length-1
* mlt_service:
  - added mlt_service_cache_purge()
  - added "_need_previous_next" handling in mlt_service_get_frame()
  - added firing event "service-changed" in mlt_service_attach()

modules:
* avformat producer:
  - added decoding H.264 with NVIDIA VDPAU
    Requires FFmpeg built with vdpau.
    This is automatically detected and enabled. You can disable this by
	setting environment variable MLT_NO_VDPAU=1 or property novdpau=1.
  - added caching of FFmpeg contexts and decoded images
    This allows large numbers of clips in a project avoiding limitations
	with number of threads and file descriptors permitted per process.
    You can disable image caching with property noimagecache=1.
  - added variant of producer named avformat-novalidate
  - restored support for video4linux(2)
* avformat consumer: added apre, fpre, and vpre preset properties
* crop filter: added center_bias integer property
* deinterlace filter: added the excellent YADIF as a method
* kdenlivetitle producer: added text outlining
* linsys/sdi consumer:
  - added support for HD-SDI
  - changed name from "linsys_sdi" to just "sdi"
* oldfilm filter: added "uneven development" effect
* xml producer: add support for unspecified out points

profiles:
* added several missing ATSC (HD) profiles
* change descriptions from using Hz to fps
